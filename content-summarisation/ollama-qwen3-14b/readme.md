# Qwen3.14b Summarization through Ollama

Qwen3.14b has a tendency to output in Chinese.

Occasionally the 'reasoning' mentions that the input prompt contains the chinese word for 'sentence'. I have never input this so if this statement is accurate then it must be part of the model.

For this experiment over 31/July/2025 and 01/August/2025 I used a transcript of this podcast:

- Episode 023 - The Software Testing Job Market in 2025 with Jack Cole - The Evil Tester Show
- https://www.eviltester.com/show/023-job-market-jack-cole/


Chinese output has been mentioned online:

I tried some settings as mentioned here:

- https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/qwen3-how-to-run-and-fine-tune#official-recommended-settings

But the settings made no difference.

The text generation was using Python with the Ollama library connecting to Ollama running locally with the Qwen3.14b model.

I used the `generate` api entry point in the client

## Prompt

The prompt I provided:

---
TASK: Summarize the main topics discussed in the following podcast transcript. Provide a concise summary with key points for the reader. Format the summary using bullets and headings.

PODCAST TRANSCRIPT: 
---

And after the `PODCAST TRANSCRIPT:` I add the transcript text.

## Output

Note that the reasoning menions that the prompt included `"Please write a summary of the above content in Chinese."`

Did the model hallucinate this in the input, or did it hallucinate this as part of the reasoning to justify the output as Chinese text?

### Reasoning

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for. They provided a long transcript of a podcast interview between someone named Alan and Jack Cole, who is a recruiter. The user then included a query in Chinese that says, "Please write a summary of the above content in Chinese." So, the task is to summarize the entire conversation in Chinese.

First, I need to understand the main points of the interview. Jack Cole talks about his work in recruitment, specifically in the QA (Quality Assurance) field. He discusses career progression for QAs, mentioning roles like product managers, SREs (Site Reliability Engineers), and DevSecOps. He also touches on the emerging field of AI QA, mentioning the need for understanding AI models and ethical hacking for security roles. Additionally, he mentions his new initiative called "Build Your Edge," which includes community events, career coaching, and podcasting. He also mentions his company, We Do Tek, and his LinkedIn profile.

Now, the user wants a summary in Chinese. I need to make sure to capture all these key points: career paths for QAs, the importance of AI and DevSecOps, the new initiatives, and the promotion of his services and LinkedIn profile. I should structure the summary clearly, perhaps in sections or bullet points, but since the user didn't specify the format, a paragraph form might be more appropriate. Also, I need to be careful with proper nouns like "We Do Tek" and "Build Your Edge" to ensure they are correctly translated or transliterated. Terms like "SRE" and "DevSecOps" might not have direct translations, so I'll keep them in English with explanations if necessary. Finally, I should check for any specific details Jack mentioned, like the white paper or resources he plans to provide, and include those as well.
