# Notebook LM

- https://notebooklm.google.com/

NotebookLM is a free tool from Google which allows summarising and querying user uploaded sources.

Sources can be PDF, Slides, Youtube, MP4, MP3, etc.

The sources are used as the context to restrict the response generation to be based only on the sources. An attempt to avoid Hallucination.

- Briefing Docs which summarise the main points in content
- Study Guides which provide outline topics and Quizes
- FAQs to provide notes in a basic Q&A format
- Timelines which can help when the content has historical overview
- Interactive mindmaps which visually summarise the content and I can navigate through it, and deep dive into what the mindmap nodes represent
- NotebookLM also provides audio overviews - which I don't use.

NotebookLM prefers to summarize content.

NotebookLM can generate content to/from different languages allowing the user to work with content from languages they do not speak/read.
