# Learning with AI

In the future, will we actually use books and courses?

Or will the courses and books be generated on demand?

In which case we would mainly need to know the key questions to ask, and possibly be taught why those key questions are important.

I created a small HTML page to experiment with this based on the topic of Exploratory Testing.

Either download the experiment.html file and try it locally or use html-preview below.

A generic page that allows configuring topic is in the topic_x_experiment.html 

- https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/learning-ai/using-ai-to-learn/topic_x_experiment.html

## Use via gitpages

- https://eviltester.github.io/ai-supported-testing-experiments/learn_topic.html

(add ?q=topic to prefill with a topic)

- [Exploratory Testing](https://eviltester.github.io/ai-supported-testing-experiments/learn_topic.html?q=Exploratory%20Testing)
- [Web Software Testing](https://eviltester.github.io/ai-supported-testing-experiments/learn_topic.html?q=Web%20Software%20Testing)
