# CounterStrings

CounterStrings are incredibly useful for testing.

A self-documenting length string, which is useful for testing string limits and surprisingly useful as a general string implementation.

e.g. 14 char string

`2*4*6*8*11*14*`

The `*` marks a position in the string and the actual position is shown by the numeric digits before it.

Here is an implementation James Bach created:

I use the format that James Bach defined.
