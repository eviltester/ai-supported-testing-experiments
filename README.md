# AI Supported Testing Experiments

AI tooling is currently moving so fast it is imposible to keep up with all tools and all developments.

This repo is an attempt to document specific time-bound experiments related to AI.

- The experimetns are time bound
- The experiments are documented
- The experiments are repeatable

I expect repeated experiments over time to demonstrate different results. Hopefully better results.

We'll see where this goes.
