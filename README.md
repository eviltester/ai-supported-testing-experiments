# AI Supported Testing Experiments

AI tooling is currently moving so fast it is imposible to keep up with all tools and all developments.

This repo is an attempt to document specific time-bound experiments related to AI.

- The experiments are time bound
- The experiments are documented
- The experiments are repeatable

I expect repeated experiments over time to demonstrate different results. Hopefully better results.


# Chat Based Tools to experiment with

## Free to access AI Chat Tooling:

- https://lambda.chat/
- https://duck.ai
- https://chatgpt.com/ 
- https://grok.com/ 
- https://www.perplexity.ai/
- https://deepai.org/
- https://chat.mistral.ai/chat
- https://claude.ai

Remember not to put any confidential information in online cloude based tooling. Particularly on free plans, but probably not at all, and remember to check settings in the cloud tools to make sure that you are not allowing someone to review the chats and responses to help train the AI further.

## Local Model Tooling:

- ollama.com
- https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all

By running the models locally we can use confidentially information without worrying too much.

Locally I've been using:

- "qwen3:14b" with Ollama for general chat
- "CodeLlama" with Ollama for code generation

With Gpt4All for general chat:

- Reasoning 1
- Llama 3b instruct
