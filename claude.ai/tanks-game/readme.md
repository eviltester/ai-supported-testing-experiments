# Tank Game

I once started writing a game like this for the Game Boy.

I didn't get much further than showing the tank on screen, moving around, and shooting bullets.

The code has long vanished into the old computer code void.

Since claude is promoted as being good for code generation. Let's try it.

On the free plan, I had to split the coding across multiple chat sessions:

- Chat 1 - https://claude.ai/share/77ad5213-83b6-43f0-8295-c401598caee6
- Chat 2 - https://claude.ai/share/c7855cff-59a9-4b2a-9109-4bfb89f46ee5
- Chat 3 - https://claude.ai/share/01b0e3ae-e07a-42fa-ae85-f99c83e00b27

The prompt output will be stored in 001-013 for chat 1

Then each follow on chat is numbered starting with the chat e.g. chat 2 is 201-208 etc.

I didn't realise I was going to run out of space in the chat when I started.

Generally, vibe coding long term in the chat is a real pain.

- Have to save out the code to switch between chats when the chat becomes full
- Switching between chats changes the flow.
- Long term - console or IDE based vibe coding would be the way forward.


- **20250812 15:20 - Session 1 - create basic game**
   - Could only use 5 prompts in the free version before running out of tokens
   - It created 21 versions of the code - saved out the full code for each prompt finish
   - Sadly prompt 5 completed with non-working code, but I coded a manual fix to get it running  [005/tank_game-005-manual-fix.html](005/tank_game-005-manual-fix.html)
   - there are additional bugs in this version in that the title screen does not fully render
   - But... I'm quite impressed to have got this far in about 20 minutes

- **20250812 20:30 - Sesssion 2 - try to fix intro sreen**
   - my free plan refreshed, but every request triggered a 500 error and is seemed like there are too many people using claude so the free plan is limited.
   - I'd prefer a better experience on the free plan. The message says that this wouldn't happen on the paid plan, but I currently don't trust it.
   - I was not able to do anything in this session

## 001 - create a basic game

> Create a Javacript game where a 2d vector tank can move around a square arena. Randomly generate enemy tanks every 10 to 15 seconds. The player an move the main vector tank by pressing the cursor keys: up to go forwards, down to go backwards, left to rotate anti-clockwise by 5 degress, right to rotate clockwise by 5 degrees. Space should shoot a bullet that will travel in the direction the player is facing.

[Playable](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/001/tank_game.html)

---

I've created a complete 2D vector tank arena game with all the features you requested! Here's what the game includes:

... _for full chat see the [shared claude.ai chat session](https://claude.ai/share/77ad5213-83b6-43f0-8295-c401598caee6)_

The game starts immediately when loaded. Try to survive as long as possible while destroying enemy tanks to rack up points!

## 002 - more enemies, shoot each other

> Amend the game so that it starts with 4 enemy tanks generated on screen. And the enemy tanks should generate with different colours. And the enemy tanks will shoot at each other as well as the player.

[Playable](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/002/tank_game.html)

---

Perfect! I've updated the tank game with all your requested changes:

---

The game is now much more dynamic with colorful enemy tanks battling each other while also trying to take you down. This creates interesting tactical situations where you can sometimes let enemies fight each other or get caught in crossfire!

---

When the game starts the tanks die. I think they are shooting themselves

## 003 - No shoot self, no trails

> Tanks should not be able to shoot themselves. The trails left behind by the tanks should completely fade away. Player should only get points when they shoot an enemy tank.

[Playable](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/003/tank_game.html)

---

Perfect! I've made all the requested changes:

...

The game now has cleaner mechanics and visuals while maintaining the chaotic multi-faction combat!

## 004 - slower, shorter, explosion

> Bullets should only have a range of  a quarter of the screen width. Bullets should travel at half their current speed. When a bullet reaches the end of the range or hits something it should explode in a coloured particle storm.

[Playable](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/004/tank_game.html)

---

Perfect! I've implemented all the requested bullet improvements:

...

The game now has much more satisfying combat with beautiful particle effects that make every shot feel impactful!

### 005 - Intro screen

> Create an intro screen which shows the game name as "Angry Tank Arena".  Explain the game basics and show keys with explanations of what they do. The player should press Space to start the game.

[Playable](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/005/tank_game.html)

The AI generated version is broken - not sure if that is because I ran out of tokens?

[Manually Fixed - Playable](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/005/tank_game-005-manual-fix.html)

---

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive intro screen for "Angry Tank Arena" with all the requested features:

...

The intro screen provides all essential information while maintaining the game's vector graphics aesthetic. Players will now have a clear understanding of the chaotic multi-faction combat before diving into the action!

---

**Actually it is now broken - but perhaps this is because I ran out of free tokens?**

I manually did a quick fix of the game in [005/tank_game-005-manual-fix.html](005/tank_game-005-manual-fix.html). It was about 5 lines of code (and upon review I can see I made it harder than I needed to, but hey... it worked)

TODO (to fix this iteration with vibing):

- The intro screen does not show all the details.
- The game over alert should be a game over animation for 10 seconds and then switch to the intro screen.

## 005 - ??? fix intro screen

I had to go through multiple prompts to fix the intro screen.

I retried prompt 005 because it died in the middle of creating it.

> Create an intro screen which shows the game name as "Angry Tank Arena".  Explain the game basics and show keys with explanations of what they do. The player should press Space to start the game.

final version 21

But this resulted in the same problem.

Then I had to issue a bunch of "fix it please" prompts.

## 006 - fix intro screen again

> The intro screen is not visible and the game does not start when space is pressed, please fix this.

final version 23

[Broken](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/006/tank_game.html)

Claude.ai confidently said that it knew what the issue was, edited the code, proclaimed it fixed. And then it didn't work.

---

The issue was that the game loop was continuing to run the game logic even when showing the intro screen, and there was a conflict with the Space key handling. I've fixed both issues:

...

The intro screen should now be visible when you load the page, and pressing Space should properly start the game!

**But it wasn't**

## 007 - fix intro screen again again

> The intro screen does not display immediately when the page loads. Pressing space does not start the game. Please fix.

final version 25

[Broken](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/007/tank_game.html)

Claude.ai confidently said that it knew what the issue was, edited the code, proclaimed it fixed. And then it didn't work.

---

I've fixed the issue! The problem was that the game loop wasn't properly starting with requestAnimationFrame.

...

The intro screen should now be visible immediately when you load the page, and pressing Space should start the game. The requestAnimationFrame ensures the intro screen renders properly and the game loop continues running smoothly.


**But it wasn't**


## 008 - fix intro screen again again again

> When the page loads, the intro screen is not displayed and the space bar does not start the game.

final version 28

[Broken](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/008/tank_game.html)


Claude.ai confidently said that it knew what the issue was, edited the code, proclaimed it fixed. And then it didn't work.

---

I see the issue! Let me debug this step by step. The problem is likely in the game loop logic or the intro screen drawing function. Let me fix this:

...

Now when you load the page:

Check the browser console (F12) to see if "Drawing intro screen" appears
Press Space and check if you see "Key pressed: Space" and "Starting game!" in the console

This will help us identify exactly where the issue is. The intro screen should now display properly, and the debug logs will show us what's happening when you press Space.

**So console logs were used to debug the code, and based on my response it would fix it? That suggests that Claude is unable to debug the code. Code is a 'side-effect' and in the Chat UI it is not possible to edit the code, so this is a deficiency in the current tooling. Perhaps Claude needs to add a debugging and defect identification Agent?**



## 009 - fix intro screen again again again again

> The intro screen is not visible to the player. All the player sees when the game starts is the blue screen. Pressing space does not start the game but it does write messages to the console that the game has started. But the game does not start and the intro screen is not visible. Fix this so that the intro screen is displayed when the page is opened and the game starts when the player presses space.

final version 30

[Broken](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/009/tank_game.html)

Claude.ai confidently knows what the problem is and will fix it. But stating "The issue was likely that" does not fill me with confidence that Claude had identified the issue. **And it had not.**

---

I see the issue! The problem is that the intro screen drawing function is being called but something is interfering with it. Let me fix this by simplifying and ensuring the intro screen displays properly:

...

The issue was likely that something was drawing over the intro screen or the canvas wasn't being cleared properly before drawing the intro content.
Now when you load the page:

You should see the intro screen with "ANGRY TANK ARENA" title and all the controls/instructions
Pressing Space should start the game and show the actual gameplay

The intro screen should now be clearly visible with white text on the blue background!

## 010 - fix intro screen again again again again again

> The intro screen is not visible and the game does not start when the player presses space. please fix.

final version 31

[Playable - 010](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/010/tank_game.html)

And again with the "the problem is likely". More likely that Claude is hacking about. But there is some hope "Let me completely rewrite this with a simpler, more reliable approach".

I have, as a programmer, given up, thrown code away and started again using the knowledge I've gained. But never so much code, and given that this was a simple bug to fix I don't think it needs a rewrite. Oh well, the AI is in charge here because I'm 'vibing'. And this was my last prompt for this free session.

Fortunately it did create working code.

---

I see the issue! The problem is likely that the game loop isn't starting properly or there's a fundamental issue with the setup. Let me completely rewrite this with a simpler, more reliable approach:

## 011 - Create Game Over Screen

> When the player dies, create an end screen with "Game Over" and which shows the score. It should animate "Game Over" for at least 2 seconds. No keyboard input should be valid during those two seconds to prevent the user leaving the end screen to quickly. It should also have fireworks in the background. The "Game Over" screen should show for 15 seconds maximum but can also be cleared when the space key is pressed. After clearing the "Game Over" screen the player should be returned to the intro screen.

**And, just like the intro screen, it doesn't work**

final version 39

---

Perfect! I've implemented a comprehensive game over screen with all the requested features:

...

The game over experience is now much more polished with beautiful fireworks and smooth animations!


## 012 - Show Game Over Screen

> The Game Over Screen is not displayed to the user, and it is not possible to press space to return to the intro screen. Fix this.

final version 42

---

I see the issue! The game over screen logic isn't working properly. Let me fix this by debugging and correcting the game loop flow:

I've added debug logs to help identify the issue. The main problem was that the game loop structure wasn't complete. Now when you:

...

Debug log shows "Game over triggered"

## 013 - 201 - Had to move to a new chat

The chat reached maximum length.

Exported the code and HTML into a new chat.

> This code was generated by claude.ai to create a tank game. But the game over screen does not show. Claude.ai added some debug logs, but when the game is over and the player dies, the debug logging show "Game over triggered" but the game over screen is not displayed. What we want is When the player dies, create an end screen with "Game Over" and which shows the score. It should animate "Game Over" for at least 2 seconds. No keyboard input should be valid during those two seconds to prevent the user leaving the end screen to quickly. It should also have fireworks in the background. The "Game Over" screen should show for 15 seconds maximum but can also be cleared when the space key is pressed. After clearing the "Game Over" screen the player should be returned to the intro screen.

---

Looking at your tank game code, I can see the issue. The game over screen logic is implemented but there's a problem in the game loop flow. When gameOverScreen() is called, it sets the flags correctly, but the game loop continues processing the running game state instead of showing the game over screen.
Let me fix this by updating the game loop structure:

...and "You've reached the limit for Claude messages at this time. Please wait before trying again. Or consider upgrading to Claude Pro"

_You are out of free messages until 7:00 PM_

**I was able to [continue] at 7PM**

But screen still not shown.

Chat 2 - version 2

## 202 - Fix Game Over Screen

> The game over screen is not  displayed but I see console messages "Game Over triggered!", then "Returning to intro" then "Starting game", but nothing is visible on screen.

Chat 2 - version 6

---

I see the issue! The game is immediately transitioning from game over back to intro and then starting again without showing the game over screen. This is happening because the game loop logic isn't properly handling the state transitions. Let me fix this:

...

The game over screen should now be visible!

**And it was.**

[Playable - 201](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/013-201/tank_game.html)

## 203 - Remove Debug Console Logs

I'm now going to start prompting in much smaller chunks to see what happens.

> Please remove all the console debug messages

chat 2 - version 10

_For some reason it created 4 code versions to remove all console log messages. That seems excessive._

---

All debug console messages have been removed from the code. The game should now run cleanly without any console output cluttering the browser's developer console.

[Playable - 203](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/203/tank_game.html)

## 204 - Add 3 lives

> Now give the player 3 lives.

chat 2 version 19

---

Perfect! I've implemented a 3-lives system for the player. Here are the key changes:

...

The player now has more survivability and the game is more forgiving, while still maintaining the challenge! The respawn system gives players a fighting chance to recover and continue their high score run.

[Playable - 204](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/204/tank_game.html)

## 205 - Add Gamepad Support

> Now add Gamepad support in addition to keyboard controls. On the gamepad up, down, left and right do the same as the cursor keys. On the gamepad button 0 should do the same as the space key.

chat 2 - version 31

---

Perfect! I've added full gamepad support to the tank game. Here are the key features added:

...

The game now supports both keyboard and gamepad controls simultaneously, making it accessible to players who prefer either input method!

**I tested it and the game wasn't working due to gamepad. I saw an exception in the console about permissions. I saved the HTML off to local disk and it ran there without exception. But the gamepad still wasn't working. When I started the game with the space bar, the gamepad was available in game, but not in the game overscreen.**

I decided to treat these as two issues and fix separately:

- get gamepad working on intro and outro screen
- prevent gamepad permissions from stopping the game from working

[Playable - 205](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/203/tank_game.html)

## 206 - Get Gamepad working

> The A button on the gamepad works in game, but does not work on the title intro screen, nor does it work on the game over screen. Currently only space works on the title screen and only space works on the end screen.

Chat 2 - Version 32

---

You're right! The issue is that the gamepad polling (updateGamepad()) is only being called during the main game loop, not on the intro or game over screens. Let me fix this:

...

Now the gamepad A button should work consistently across all screens, just like the space key does!

[Playable - 206](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/206/tank_game.html)

## 207 - Try Catch Gamepad Exception

> Now, catch the exception for SecurityError when gamepad is disallowed by permissions policy. The game should still render all screens and be playable by keyboard when this happens.

Chat 2 - version 33

---

Perfect! I've added proper exception handling for gamepad permissions. Here's what the fix does:

...

Now the game is robust against gamepad permission restrictions and will work perfectly in environments where gamepad access is disabled by security policies, while still providing the enhanced experience when gamepad access is available.

[Playable - 207](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/207/tank_game.html)

## 208 - Reduce Spawn Time

I've noticed that it takes too long for new enemies to spawn. So I want to change that.

> Each time a tank is shot, reduce the re-spawn time by half a second. The re-spawn time should never go lower than half a second.

Chat 2 - version 38

[Playable - 208](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/208/tank_game.html)

---

Perfect! I've implemented the escalating difficulty system. Here's what I added:

...


This creates a natural difficulty curve where skilled players who survive longer face increasingly challenging scenarios, making high scores more rewarding and the game more exciting as it progresses!

---

And... I didn't really think this through. It's actually hard to know if it is increasing, I should have done this after I introduced the concept of levels I think.

## 209 - Add Levels - end of chat - failed

> Introduce the concept of levels. We start on level 1. When all enemy tanks are destroyed we advance a level. When we advance a level display the Message "Level Complete", make the message rotate and sparkle. The message should display for 2 seconds. When the next level starts add one more enemy tank and reduce the spawn interval.

And... I got errors, claude reached the maximum length of a message and I reached maximum length of the chat.

Chat 2 - version 56

The code is throwing syntax errors, and when I click to the browser the entire claude UI crashes.

I'll have to:

- export last working code
- start a new chat
- imiport last working code into prompt and try again


## 301 - Add Levels

New Chat

> This code was generated by claude.ai to create a tank game. Introduce the concept of levels. We start on level 1. When all enemy tanks are destroyed we advance a level. When we advance a level display the Message "Level Complete", make the message rotate and sparkle. The message should display for 2 seconds. When the next level starts add one more enemy tank and reduce the spawn interval.


---

I have reached the limit for claude messages... try later.

...time passes...

...Thorin sits down and starts singing about gold...

Perfect! I've successfully added a complete level system to your tank game with all the features you requested:

...

The game now has a proper progression system where players must clear each level to advance, with increasing difficulty and satisfying visual feedback for completing levels!

---

Chat 3 - v 2

Sadly the game no longer starts.

## 302 - fix game

> The game no longer shows the intro screen and does not start when pressing space.

---

You're right! I see the issue. The problem is in the drawIntroScreen() function - it's missing the closing brace and the rest of the code. Let me fix this:

The issue was that the HTML structure was incomplete. Now the game should properly show the intro screen when you load it and respond to the space key to start the game.

...

Try refreshing the page and you should see the intro screen, and pressing space should start the game with the new level system!

Chat 3 - v 3

**That worked**

[Playable - 302](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/eviltester/ai-supported-testing-experiments/blob/main/claude.ai/tanks-game/302/tank_game.html)

We should add some sounds.

## 303 - add shooting sounds

> Add a sound when the main player shoots and a different sound when the enemy shoots. The sounds should be short and low.

Chat 3 - v8 

---

I'll add audio effects for player and enemy shooting using the Web Audio API to create short, low-pitched sounds. Let me update the code:

...

Perfect! I've added sound effects for shooting with the following features:

## 304 - add gameover sound

> When the game over screen is initially shown play a short 2-3 second downwards sequence of notes.

I'll add a game over sound that plays a descending sequence of notes when the game over screen first appears. Let me update the code:

...

Perfect! I've added a game over sound that plays a melancholic descending sequence of musical notes when the game over screen first appears.

...

The sound creates a dramatic, melancholic effect that enhances the emotional impact of losing the game, while the descending musical phrase reinforces the "falling/failing" theme of game over!

## 305 - end of level sound

I'll add a level complete sound that plays an ascending, swirly sequence of notes during the level completion animation. Let me update the code:

Perfect! I've added a celebratory level complete sound that plays an ascending, swirly sequence of notes when the level completion screen appears.

...

The sound creates an uplifting, magical effect that reinforces the achievement of completing a level, with the swirly vibrato adding a whimsical, celebratory quality that matches the visual sparkles and rotating text!

## 306 - game start sound

> When the player starts the game, play a triumphant dah dah dahhh "going into battle" sound.

I'll add a triumphant "going into battle" sound that plays when the player starts the game. Let me update the code:

Perfect! I've added a triumphant "going into battle" fanfare that plays when the player starts the game.

...

The sound creates an epic, heroic moment when transitioning from the menu to gameplay, like a battle horn calling troops to charge into the tank arena! It perfectly captures the excitement of starting a new game and entering the battlefield.

## 307 - life lost sound

> Can you add a low explosion noise when the player loses a life

chat 3 v 16

---

Perfect! I've added a realistic low explosion sound that plays whenever the player loses a life (whether they respawn or get game over).

...

The explosion sound adds significant impact and feedback when the player takes damage, making hits feel much more dramatic and satisfying. The low rumbling frequency range makes it feel like a proper tank explosion rather than a small pop!

### 308 extra life every 1500 points

> Everytime the player gains another 1500 points, give the player an extra life and make a short bell ring sound.

TODO: 

- add power ups - enemies not allowed to pick these up, speed up, longer shots, invulnerability - last for random time between 20 and 30 seconds, hear beep beep when they are about to be lost?
- wasd as additional up, left, down, right keys
- add bombs which are dropped when enemy is hit - explode after a few seconds with a larger blast radius
- add craters when explode to create terrain obstacles - allow these to fade away
- allow enemies to pick up power ups in later levels e.g. from level 20 onwards?
- introduce gamepad control support for right stick and triggers
- possibly introduce smart bombs with a different fire button - wide range that doesn't impact player? Could be gained with score increases or picked up?
