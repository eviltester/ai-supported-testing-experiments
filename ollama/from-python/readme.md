# Simple Python Code Example

Simple example of using Ollama with Python.

Ollama itself needs to be installed.

And any models you want to use should be installed e.g.

```
ollama pull lamma3.1:latest
```

## Output

# llama3.1

## Performance Testing

Performance testing is a type of software testing that focuses on evaluating the performance and scalability of an application or system under various workloads, usage patterns, and conditions. The primary goal of performance testing is to ensure that the system can handle the expected load and perform as required in real-world scenarios.

Performance testing involves measuring the response time, throughput, and resource utilization of a system when subjected to specific loads, such as:

1. **Peak traffic**: Testing how the system performs during periods of high usage or peak demand.
2. **Concurrent users**: Simulating multiple users accessing the system simultaneously to evaluate its capacity.
3. **Workload variability**: Testing how the system responds to changing workloads, such as varying levels of data transfer, CPU usage, or memory requirements.

The key aspects of performance testing include:

1. **Load testing**: Evaluating the system's ability to handle a specific load or number of users.
2. **Stress testing**: Pushing the system beyond its expected capacity to determine its breaking point and identify potential weaknesses.
3. **Endurance testing**: Testing the system's ability to sustain performance over an extended period under heavy loads.
4. **Scalability testing**: Evaluating how well the system scales with increasing load or user numbers.

Performance testing helps organizations:

1. **Identify bottlenecks**: Pinpoint areas where the system is slowing down and optimize them for better performance.
2. **Predict resource needs**: Estimate the required resources (e.g., CPU, memory, storage) to support expected workloads.
3. **Improve user experience**: Ensure that the system provides a good user experience even under heavy loads or peak usage periods.

Common tools used for performance testing include:

1. Apache JMeter
2. Gatling
3. NeoLoad
4. LoadRunner
5. Apache Bench (ab)

Performance testing is an essential part of software development and deployment, as it helps ensure that the system can meet the expected demands of users, customers, or other stakeholders.

## Exploratory Testing

Exploratory Testing (ET) is a software testing approach where the tester tests a product or application with minimal pre-determined test cases. Instead, the tester explores and interacts with the system in a flexible manner to uncover bugs and identify potential issues.

In ET, the tester has no prior knowledge of what to expect from the system, and instead uses their experience, intuition, and creativity to explore different scenarios, features, and user interfaces. This approach encourages a deeper understanding of the product's functionality, usability, and performance.

Key characteristics of Exploratory Testing:

1. **No pre-defined test cases**: The tester doesn't follow a set of predetermined test cases or scripts.
2. **Flexibility**: The tester can adjust their testing strategy based on what they discover during testing.
3. **Improvisation**: The tester uses their experience and intuition to decide where to focus next in the testing process.
4. **Active investigation**: The tester actively investigates issues, trying different approaches to understand the behavior of the system.

Benefits of Exploratory Testing:

1. **Improved coverage**: By not being constrained by pre-defined test cases, ET can uncover more defects, especially those related to usability and user experience.
2. **Reduced testing time**: Since testers don't need to spend time creating or executing pre-defined test cases, they can start testing sooner.
3. **Increased engagement**: Exploratory Testing encourages active investigation and creative thinking, which can lead to a more engaging and effective testing process.

However, Exploratory Testing also has its challenges:

1. **Higher skill level required**: Testers need strong technical skills, as well as the ability to think critically and creatively.
2. **Unpredictability**: The outcome of ET is not always predictable, which can make it difficult to manage expectations or provide a clear estimate of testing time.

To successfully implement Exploratory Testing, consider the following best practices:

1. **Develop a basic understanding** of the system's functionality before starting ET.
2. **Establish clear goals and objectives**: Identify what you want to achieve through ET, such as identifying usability issues or exploring specific features.
3. **Use tools and techniques**: Utilize tools like test management software, note-taking, and recording capabilities to support the testing process.

By embracing Exploratory Testing, teams can uncover hidden defects, improve product quality, and enhance their overall testing efficiency.
